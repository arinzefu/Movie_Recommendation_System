I used tensorflow framework to recommend movies based on a user's watch history and the documentation on the dataset is in 'Recommender System'.
The dataset was found on kaggle and I used only the data I found relevant.
The URL of the dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset
I replaced the -1 in the array cause it was not part of the range expected which may also affect the end accuracy.
I achieved a 96% accuracy and I saved the model to 'Model'. Your opinion is appreciated.
